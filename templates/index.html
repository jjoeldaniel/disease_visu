            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">Welcome to our study on foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States. This study aims to analyze the
                relationship between foodborne illness outbreaks, coastal states, and population density. Our research
                provides
                valuable insights into the distribution of outbreaks and the impact of coastal states on the occurrence
                of
                foodborne illnesses. The study was conducted by Joel Daniel Rico and Melissa Huynh.</p>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-center">Methodology</h4>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">We collected data on foodborne illness outbreaks from various sources and analyzed the information for
                all 50
                states in the United States. The dataset includes information on the coastal classification, population
                density,
                and outbreak counts for each state.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Findings</h2>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">Here are the key findings from our study:</p>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Population Density</h4>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">We observed that the coastal states generally have higher population densities compared to non-coastal
                states.
                This could be attributed to factors such as urbanization and tourism.</p>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Foodborne Illness Outbreaks</h4>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">Our analysis revealed a higher number of foodborne illness outbreaks in coastal states compared to
                non-coastal
                states. Coastal states accounted for approximately 82% of all reported outbreaks, indicating a
                significant
                correlation between coastal states and foodborne illness incidents.</p>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Correlations</h4>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">The density-outbreak correlation suggests a weak positive relationship between population density and the
                number
                of foodborne illness outbreaks. While this correlation is relatively weak, it implies that higher
                population
                density may contribute to a slightly increased risk of foodborne illnesses.</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
            <br class="md:hidden">
            <p class="md:max-w-sm md:pt-7">The coastal outbreak correlation, on the other hand, indicates a moderate positive relationship between
                coastal
                states and the occurrence of foodborne illness outbreaks. This finding highlights the importance of
                considering
                the coastal factor when studying and addressing food safety measures.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">Our study provides valuable insights into the distribution of foodborne illness outbreaks in the United
                States.
                The higher number of outbreaks in coastal states and the positive correlations observed emphasize the
                need for
                targeted preventive measures and food safety regulations in these areas.</p>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">Understanding the relationship between coastal states, population density, and foodborne illness
                outbreaks can
                aid policymakers, health authorities, and food industry professionals in implementing effective
                strategies to
                mitigate the risk of foodborne illnesses and ensure the safety of consumers nationwide.</p>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">Further research and analysis are recommended to delve deeper into the specific factors contributing to
                the
                higher prevalence of foodborne illnesses in coastal states and to explore additional correlations
                between
                outbreak occurrences and various demographic, environmental, and socio-economic factors.</p>
            <p class="md:max-w-sm">Thank you for your interest in our study on foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States!</p>
