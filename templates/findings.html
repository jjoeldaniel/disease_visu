    <h1 class="text-3xl text-center font-bold">Study on Foodborne Illness Outbreaks in the United States</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Introduction</h2>

    <p>Welcome to our study on foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States. This study aims to analyze the
        relationship between foodborne illness outbreaks, coastal states, and population density. Our research provides
        valuable insights into the distribution of outbreaks and the impact of coastal states on the occurrence of
        foodborne illnesses. The study was conducted by [Your Name] and [Melissa's Name].</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Methodology</h3>

    <p>We collected data on foodborne illness outbreaks from various sources and analyzed the information for all 50
        states in the United States. The dataset includes information on the coastal classification, population density,
        and outbreak counts for each state.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Findings</h2>

    <p>Here are the key findings from our study:</p>

    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Coastal vs. Non-Coastal States</h4>

    <p>The United States has a significant number of coastal states, representing 60% of the total states in our
        dataset.</p>

    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Population Density</h4>

    <p>We observed that the coastal states generally have higher population densities compared to non-coastal states.
        This could be attributed to factors such as urbanization and tourism.</p>

    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Foodborne Illness Outbreaks</h4>

    <p>Our analysis revealed a higher number of foodborne illness outbreaks in coastal states compared to non-coastal
        states. Coastal states accounted for approximately 82% of all reported outbreaks, indicating a significant
        correlation between coastal states and foodborne illness incidents.</p>

    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Coastal Outbreak Percentage</h4>

    <p>The percentage of total outbreaks that occurred in coastal states is 81.92%. This finding further emphasizes the
        higher vulnerability of coastal states to foodborne illnesses.</p>

    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Correlations</h4>

    <p>The density-outbreak correlation suggests a weak positive relationship between population density and the number
        of foodborne illness outbreaks. While this correlation is relatively weak, it implies that higher population
        density may contribute to a slightly increased risk of foodborne illnesses.</p>

    <p>The coastal outbreak correlation, on the other hand, indicates a moderate positive relationship between coastal
        states and the occurrence of foodborne illness outbreaks. This finding highlights the importance of considering
        the coastal factor when studying and addressing food safety measures.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Our study provides valuable insights into the distribution of foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States.
        The higher number of outbreaks in coastal states and the positive correlations observed emphasize the need for
        targeted preventive measures and food safety regulations in these areas.</p>

    <p>Understanding the relationship between coastal states, population density, and foodborne illness outbreaks can
        aid policymakers, health authorities, and food industry professionals in implementing effective strategies to
        mitigate the risk of foodborne illnesses and ensure the safety of consumers nationwide.</p>

    <p>Further research and analysis are recommended to delve deeper into the specific factors contributing to the
        higher prevalence of foodborne illnesses in coastal states and to explore additional correlations between
        outbreak occurrences and various demographic, environmental, and socio-economic factors.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your interest in our study on foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States!</p>
